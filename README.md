# Entity Scan Demo

I had a question from a student come up that a lot of new Spring developers come across. It has to do with creating components and in this case more specifically, entities. Let's take a look at the question and then dive into the solution. 

"Hey, I'm trying to get JPA to create the post and author tables and view them in the H2 console.  I copied every step in the video and tried the suggestions to change the JDBC url to :testdb.

Here is the code in a repo, if that helps!"
